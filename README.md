1. **Grab the Current Code:**

    First, our tool looks at what you're working on. It takes the code from the open file in your editor. If the file is new and empty, that's okay too‚Äîour AI can handle that.

2. **Your Instructions**

    Next, you tell the tool what you need. You can type this in a box at the bottom left of the AI Coding panel. We've also got some common tasks ready to go, like adding packages or making tests.

3. **AI Does Its Thing (OpenAI Completions API)**

    Then, we send your instructions and the code to the AI. It starts working and keeps going until it's done writing the code you need.

4. **You Check the Code**

    Finally, you get to see the new code next to your old one, just like when you look at changes in Git. If you like what you see, hit accept, and the new code gets added to your file. Simple as that!
